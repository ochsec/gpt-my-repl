Gelatin is derived from collagen, a protein found in animal tissues, such as skin and bones. It is processed into a powder or sheets that can be dissolved in hot water. When the gelatin mixture cools and sets, it forms a semi-solid, jiggly dessert known as Jello. Flavorings, colorings, and additional ingredients can be added to enhance the taste and appearance of Jello."
